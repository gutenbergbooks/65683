<p>The four letters here printed for the
first time are part of Henry James’s informal
correspondence with William
Heinemann, the publisher. They are selected
for their unity of subject, in that
they concern themselves with James’s
impressions of Ibsen’s “Little Eyolf”
and contain some general remarks on
the drama. Written about the time of
the publication of the first and second
series of James’s Theatricals, they indicate
his ideas at the time when his
consideration of the subject was most
intense. Acknowledgment is made to
Mrs. J. Tucker Murray and to Pierre
de Chaignon la Rose, Esq., for permission
to print two of these letters.</p>

<p class="noi">My dear Heinemann,</p>

<p>I feel as if I couldn’t thank you
enough for introducing me to Ibsen’s
prodigious little performance! I return
it to you, by the same post conscientiously
after two breathless perusals,—which
leave me with a yearning as impatient,
an appetite as hungry, for the
rest, as poor Rita’s yearning &amp; appetite
are for the missing caresses of her Alfred.
Do satisfy me better or more
promptly than he satisfied her. The
thing is immensely characteristic &amp; immensely—immense.
I quite agree with
you that it takes hold as nothing else<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of his has as yet done—it appeals
with an immoderate intensity &amp; goes
straight as a dose of castor oil! I hope
to heaven the thing will reach the London
stage: there ought to be no difficulty,
if Rita, when she offers herself, can
be restricted to a chair, instead of lying
on her back on the sofa. Let her <em>sit</em>, and
the objection vanishes—I mean let her
eschew the sofa. Of course I don’t know
what the rest brings forth—but this act
&amp; a half are a pure—or an impure—perfection.
If he really carries on the
whole play simply with these four people—&amp;
at the same high pitch (it’s the
<em>pitch</em> that’s so magnificent!) it will be a
feat more extraordinary than any he’s
achieved—it will beat “Ghosts.” Admirable,
gallant old man! The success
of this would be high! I greatly enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
our “lovely luxurious” (as Rita wd. say),
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fin de soirée</i>, on Monday. Tree is as
dewily infantine as Eyolf!</p>

<p class="noic">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">Henry James</p>

<p class="noi">P.S. <em>Do</em> remember that I’m on the sofa,
with my hair down—and pink lamp
shades!</p>

November 22nd, 1894.</p>

<p class="noi">My dear Heinemann,</p>

<p>All thanks for your prompt and
adequate relief—the last “go” at Act II.
It is a very great little affair. If Act III
doesn’t drop, it will be Ibsen’s crown of
glory—I mean the whole thing will. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
is a little masterpiece. It seems to me
that he doesn’t make quite enough—(in
form, in the pause to take it in, and the
indication of the amazement and emotion
of Allmers)—of the revelation of
the non-relationship; but that is a detail,
and the stroke itself—coming where it
does—immense. The thing must and
<em>can</em> be represented. This Act 2 is such
a crescendo on 1. that if 3 is an equal
crescendo on 2, the fortune of the thing
will be made, and it will be a big fortune.
I hope 3 is already on the stocks
of translation. It’s a fine case for the
British manager’s fine old demand for
a “happy ending!” What I seem dimly
to divine is that the she-Eyolf goes the
same way as the He! i. e. the way of
the fiord.</p>

<p>I don’t see what <em>complete</em> tragedy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
there is for it <em>but</em> that. But the Devil
knows what queer card the old Roué
has up his sleeve!—Perhaps Rita “has”
the roadmaster publicly on the stage,
while Asta throws herself into the fiord.
Yes, Eyolf No. 2 does by design what
Eyolf No. 1 did by accident—and does
it conjointly <em>with</em> Alfred (at the risk of
repeating Rosmersholm and Hedda and
the Wild Duck), while Rita falls upon
Borgheim and the Rat wife returns
leading in a wild dance of rodents!
That, at least, is the way it <em>should</em> be.
But come to my aid! I was so full of it
yesterday that, being near you, I popped
in—tho’ I had already written, but only
missed you.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours ever,</p>

<p class="right">H. J.</p>

<p class="noi">Dear Mr. Pawling,</p>

<p>Many thanks for your missive of
yesterday &amp; the message from the publisher-dramatist,
whose friendly thought
of sending me the play I much appreciate.
I have read it, and, having done
so, feel that such reflections as it may
have engendered had better be imparted
to Heinemann directly. Therefore I will
write to him by the time he shall have
returned from Manchester—&amp; I will in
returning him the sheets also send back
the 3d. act of Ibsen, which I ought already
to have restored &amp; of which I
spoke perhaps a little too despairingly
on Sunday night at Gosse’s. On reading
it over more deliberately the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
day, I saw more its great intention of
beauty. It is meagre &amp; inconclusive, I
think; but none the less I can imagine
that, played with some real effort—&amp;
in a scenic Scandinavian twilight, it may
have a certain fine solemnity &amp; poetry
of effect.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours very truly</p>

<p class="right">Henry James</p>

<p class="right">34, De Vere Gardens. W.<br />
November 30th, 1894.</p>

<p class="noi">My dear Heinemann,</p>

<p>All thanks for the privilege of
perusal—which I greatly appreciate. I
applaud the boldness with which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
attack <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de front</i> all the difficulties of the
damnable little art, and which ought to
bring you all honour. It is refreshingly
courageous of you, for example, to have
staked your fortune on a dramatis personae
of 3, when you might, like H.A.
Jones, have sought safety in 30 or so. I
think the idea of the <i>First Step</i> interesting—the
situation of the girl who has
become a man’s mistress, but rises in
arms at the idea that her sister should
do so—but I am not certain that it
stands forth, as the <em>subject</em>, with that big
dotting of the big <em>i</em>, that the barbarous
art of the actable drama requires. In
that art one must specify one’s subject
as unmistakeably as one orders one’s
<em>di</em>nner—I mean leave the audience
no trouble to disengage or disentangle
it. Forget not that you write for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
stupid—that is, that your maximum of
refinement must meet the minimum of
intelligence of the audience—the intelligence,
in other words, of the biggest
ass it may conceivably contain. It is a
most unholy trade! But you are very
brave and gay and easy with it. You
have attempted a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de force</i> in trying
to carry on 2 acts with only three
people (I can think of no other case
but Maupassant’s <cite>Paix du Ménage</cite>—performed
at the Français after his death
by Bartet, Le Bargy &amp; Worms), and
with only one question, as it were, to
create in the bosom of the spectator
that principle of <em>suspense</em> which is the
essence of the function of a theatrical
action—the suspense as to whether or
no, and <em>how</em>, by what means or by
what catastrophe, a certain thing will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
happen or fail. The particular thing, in
the <i>First Step</i>, is the fate of the young
sister’s chastity, the “question” whether
or no Annie shall lose her or save her.
It is interesting but I am not sure it <em>fills</em>
the play enough—and whether in your
very laudable desire to be unconventional
and real you haven’t simplified
too much. However, this will show in
the test—though I pity you for the ordeal
of interpretation. I can’t help wishing
Annie were rather worse herself, for
the dramatic effect of the contrast between
her own life and character and
her intensity about the other girl; in
other words, I think you have made
her too good and the man she lives
with too bad. The situation would have
had a fuller force if his entanglement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
with the actress had been more <em>represented</em>—so
that (with the actress <em>introduced</em>)
the action would have been
closer and the effect of the circumstances
leading Frank to sacrifice the
girl more pictured, more dramatic. Excuse
this preachment. I didn’t mean to
pick holes in your so serious and honourable
attempt—but only to show you
with what care I have read it and how
much it has made me reflect!</p>

<p>I owe you also long-delayed thanks
for the Ibsen—I mean Act III, which
I also return. It is a great—a very
great <em>drop</em>; but it has distinct beauty
and it could, in representation, I think
be made fine.</p>

<p>All success to your own tragic Muse.
She is evidently much in earnest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
she is altogether in the movement. Do
take with her also, after this, another
turn.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
